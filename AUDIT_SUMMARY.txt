DETAILED ANALYSIS
-----------------
See: TASK_COMPLETION_AUDIT.md for full breakdown with code snippets and file paths

KEY INSIGHT
-----------
All major features are implemented in code. Task system is simply out of sync with actual
development progress. Wave 3 and early Wave 4 work (B0-B5, P5-P8, L1, L4) show consistent
delivery across quiz, SEO, admin, and design system fronts.

Recommendation: Sync immediately, then focus on polish items (email, PDF, schemas).
